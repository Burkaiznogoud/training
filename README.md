"# snake" 
"# snake On this simple game I try to separate presentation layer from logic layer of the program. Simple WSAD keys allow to control the movement of the snake. The point of the game is to make snake's body the longest. Player will decide how the field of the game will look like each time the game starts. W - go up / S - go down / A - go left / D - go right."
